          ABOUT US
        </h5>
        <p>
          After conducting Research and Development (R&D) for almost 8 years, we had managed to invent the world’s first
          technique to can food using Aluminum Retort Pouch inside a small Sterilizer that is affordable, economical
          and simplest food canning set at only RM8,999 (inclusive of GST and Free Delivery Nationwide).
        </p>

        <p>
          This is achieved after studying thousands of articles and research paper, doing more than 800 experiments, discussing
          with experts from 7 countries which are United States, United Kingdom, China, Hong Kong, India, Malaysia
          and Singapore, purchasing 2 sets of high temperature data logger and pressure data logger and through collaborating
          with University Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) who is our technical partner.
        </p>

        <p>
          With our invented technique and “Eazy Canner” small canning set, for the first time in the world, millions of
          poor people, single mothers, unemployed youth, retrenched workers etc, can now start a small food canning
          business from home affordably and viably. Now everyone can become a food canning entrepreneur.
        </p>

        <p>Our invented food canning technique has passed all the food canning safety standards of the following organisations:</p>
        <ul style="list-style: decimal; margin-left: 25px;">
          <li>MARDI - Malaysian Agricultural Research and Development Institute</li>
          <li>USDA – United State Department of Agriculture</li>
          <li>UNFAO – United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisations</li>
          <li>WHO- World Health Organisation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We are the winner and recipient of “Cip Catalyst” Research and Prototyping grant worth RM116,000 from Cradle
          Fund Sdn Bhd. A wholly owned company by the Ministry of Finance, Malaysia.

          We are a Joint Venture company with Universiti Technologi Malaysia (www.utm.my). They are our technical partner
          and have helped us in improving the efficiency aspect of this invented technique. We has done the following
          test and they all passed with flying colours!
        </p>
        <ul class="list-square">
          <li>Microbe Test – All microbe and virus has been killed using our Eazy Canner Sterilizer.</li>
          <li>
            Nutritional Value Test – The nutritional value for all food processed still remains, though at a lower value
            compared to freshly cooked food.
          </li>
          <li>
            Shelf Life Studies-Food processed using our technique and canning set can last up to 2 years without using
            any preservative and need no refrigeration.
          </li>
          <li>
            Temperature Test- Temperature is proven to reach 121 degree celcius inside the food processed inside the
            Aluminum Retort Pouch. This ensures all microbes are killed.
          </li>
          <li>Pressure Test – Proper pressure is achieved to ensure all microbes are killed using our Eazy Canner Sterilizer.</li>
        </ul>
